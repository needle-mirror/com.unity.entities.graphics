* Fixed Standalone crash due to deadlocks.
* Fixed missing volume component from standalone player.
* Fixed URP Particle Shaders error on MeshRenderer in subscene.
* Fixed URP Forward+ check sometimes failing in URP Projects configured for 2D rendering.

### Known Issues

* The workflow with auto-generated lightmaps is not supported and for entity-based applications it is disabled. Therefore, lightmaps should manually be generated through Window > Rendering > Lighting.
* When there is no directional light outside the subscene, ambient lighting will be missing from the editor's playmode and the player. Other lighting data e.g. max distance for cascade shadows will also be different compared to when directional light is outside the subscene.
* If there a camera renders into a RenderTexture and this RenderTexture is assigned on a material on a MeshRenderer object inside the subscene, the RenderTexture will be incorrect in player.
* Shader variants for DOTS_INSTANCING_ON will always be compiled and included in player build as they are not being stripped even if they are not in use. This could result in longer player build time and potentially increase runtime memory usage.
* If a scene has fog enabled or has lightmap, and if the subscene does not have the same fog / lightmap settings, when making a player build, the subscene objects will be rendering wrong as they have wrong fog mode / lightmap modes as the shader variant is being stripped.
* Preview is not supported for ParticleSystem and VisualEffect (VFX) objects in subscene.
* ParticleSystem in subscene with Light module won't render the lights.
* When HDRP PlanarReflectionProbe object is in subscene, it is expected that the 'Maximum Planar Reflection Probes on Screen' property in the HDRP asset needs to be increased.
* Subtractive lighting mode renders incorrectly in subscene.
* HDRP LocalVolumetricFog component renders 2x density in subscene.
* HDRP LitTessellation shader errors on OSX Metal.
* LOD max level does not work for entities.
* LOD crossfade is not supported for entities.
* Vertex attributes in Rendering Debugger renders pink for entities in URP.
* URP Decal Projector does not work inside the subscene.
* Lens flare component is not supported in subscene.
* Textmesh Pro component is not supported in subscene.
* UI and Canvas components are not supported in subscene.
* SpeedTree shaders are not supported in subscene in URP.
* Universal render Pipeline/ 2D shaders are not supported on a MeshRenderer. Note: SpriteRenderer components are companion components.
* Universal render Pipeline/VR shaders are not supported in subscene.
* Terrains are not supported in subscene.
* On Console, there is a subscene async load crash issue that might cause player build crashes very quickly after running.
* On Console, there might be some lighting artifacts due to GfxDevice issues.
* On Console, objects in scenes with multiple cameras might flicker in player due to an issue in native graphics jobs.


## [1.0.8] - 2023-04-17

## [0.13.0] - 2021-03-15

### Removed

* Removed an unused internal struct that could cause compiler warnings.

### Fixed

* Entities that use the ambient light probe now have no SH components and use much less memory.
* Fixed a bug where global ambient probes were not always rendered correctly.

## [0.12.0] - 2021-01-26

### Added

* `CountNewChunksJob`, which is responsible for counting the number of new chunks since last frame, and filling the `newChunks` array.
* New #define DISABLE_HYBRID_LIGHT_PROBES to disable light probes globally to save memory.

### Changed

* (Root)LodRequirement component split to (Root)LodRange and (Root)LodWorldReferencePoint. The LOD ranges are created during conversion and the world reference point gets recalculated every frame. Splitting them allows performance optimizations.
* LODGroupWorldReferencePoint component added to LOD/HLOD groups. Allows us to transform the LOD pivot point once per group and storing it instead of doing repeated work per leaf entity. Total LODRequirementSystem performance increase up to 2x (when combined with the optimization above).
* Cache `GetComponentTypeHandle<>()` calls instead of doing them for each jobs.
* `UpdateAllHybridChunksJob` does not count the number of new chunks since last frame anymore.
* No longer track shader reflection version changes in `HybridRendererSystem`. A new system is now taking care of that in the `StructuralChangePresentationSystemGroup`

* Improved GameObject conversion of light mapped objects during incremental conversion.
* Fixed a performance regression related to ambient probe update when probe grid was not available
* Do not perform structural changes in the `HybridRendererSystem` anymore.
* Static objects now always have per-object motion vectors disabled, regardless of MeshRenderer settings.



## [0.11.0] - 2020-11-13

### Added

* Frame queuing limiting solution to avoid hazards in the GPU uploader
* Hybrid V2 should now render objects with errors (e.g. missing or broken material) as bright magenta when the used SRP contains compatible error shaders, and display warnings.
* Support for lightmaps in hybrid renderer. You will need to bake with subscenes open, upon closing the lightmaps will be converted into the subscene. (Note: Requires release 10.1.0 of graphics packages).
* Support for lightprobes in hybrid renderer. Entities can dynamically look up the the current ambient probe or probe grid. (Note: Requires release 10.1.0 of graphics packages).
* Added error message when total used GPU memory is bigger than some backends can handle (1 GiB)
* HybridBatchPartition shared component that can force entities into separate batches.
* It is now possible to override DOTS instanced material properties using `ISharedComponentData`.
* RenderMeshDescription and RenderMeshUtility.AddComponent APIs to efficiently create Hybrid Rendered entities.

* Update minimum editor version to 2020.1.2f1

### Fixed

* Fixed float2 and float3 material properties like HDRP emissive color to work correctly.
* GPU buffer now grows by doubling, so initial startup lag is reduced.
* GPU resources are now cleaned up better in case of internal exceptions, leading to less errors in subsequent frames.

* Fixed a bug with motion vector parameters not getting set correctly.
* HLOD conversion code now properly handles uninitialized components
* Removed internal frame queuing and replace it with frame fencing. Hybrid renderer will now longer wait for GPU buffers to be available, making it easier to see if you are GPU or CPU bound and avoiding some potential deadlocks.
* Disable deformation systems when no graphics device is present instead of throwing error.
* Fixed a bug with converting ambient light probe settings from GameObjects.

## [0.10.0] - 2020-09-24

* Fixed parallel for checking errors in occlusion jobs.


## [0.8.0] - 2020-08-04


### Changed

* Changed SkinnedMeshRendererConversion to take the RootBone into account. The render entities are now parented to the RootBone entity instead of the SkinnedMeshRenderer GameObject entity. As a result the RenderBounds will update correctly when the root bone is transformed.

### Added (Hybrid V2)

* DisableRendering tag component for disabling rendering of entities

### Changed

* Improved hybrid.renderer landing document. Lots of new information.

### Fixed

* Fixed shadow mapping issues, especially when using the built-in renderer.

### Misc

* Highlighting additional changes introduced in `0.3.4-preview.24` which were not part of the previous changelogs, see below.


## [0.4.0] - 2020-03-13

### Added (All Versions)

* HeapAllocator: Offset allocator for sub-allocating resources such as NativeArrays or ComputeBuffers.

### Added (Hybrid V2)

Hybrid Renderer V2 is a new experimental renderer. It has a significantly higher performance and better feature set compared to the existing hybrid renderer. However, it is not yet confirmed to work on all platforms. To enable Hybrid Renderer V2, use the `ENABLE_HYBRID_RENDERER_V2` define in the Project Settings.

* HybridHDRPSamples Project for sample Scenes, unit tests and graphics tests.
* HybridURPSamples Project for sample Scenes, unit tests and graphics tests.
* MaterialOverride component: User friendly way to configure material overrides for shader properties.
* MaterialOverrideAsset: MaterialOverride asset for configuring general material overrides tied to a shader.
* SparseUploader: Delta update ECS data on GPU ComputeBuffer.
* Support for Unity built-in material properties: See BuiltinMaterialProperties directory for all IComponentData structs.
* Support for HDRP material properties: See HDRPMaterialProperties directory for all IComponentData structs.
* Support for URP material properties: See URPMaterialProperties directory for all IComponentData structs.
* New API (2020.1) to directly write to ComputeBuffer from parallel Burst jobs.
* New API (2020.1) to render Hybrid V2 batches though optimized SRP Batcher backend.

### Changes (Hybrid V2)

* Full rewrite of RenderMeshSystemV2 and InstancedRenderMeshBatchGroup. New code is located at `HybridV2RenderSystem.cs`.
* Partial rewrite of culling. Now all culling code is located at `HybridV2Culling.cs`.
* Hybrid Renderer and culling no longer use hash maps or IJobNativeMultiHashMapVisitKeyMutableValue jobs. Chunk components and chunk/forEach jobs are used instead.
* Batch setup and update now runs in parallel Burst jobs. Huge performance benefit.
* GPU persistent data model. ComputeBuffer to store persistent data on GPU side. Use `chunk.DidChange<T>` to delta update only changed data. Huge performance benefit.
* Per-instance shader constants are no longer setup to constant buffers for each viewport. This makes HDRP script main thread cost significantly smaller and saves significant amount of CPU time in render thread.

### Fixed

* Fixed culling issues (disappearing entities) 8000+ meters away from origin.
* Fixes to solve chunk fragmentation issues with ChunkWorldRenderBounds and other chunk components. Some changes were already included in 0.3.4 package, but not documented.
* Removed unnecessary reference to Unity.RenderPipelines.HighDefinition.Runtime from asmdef.
* Fixed uninitialized data issues causing flickering on some graphics backends (2020.1).

### Misc

* Highlighting `RenderBounds` component change introduced in `0.3.4-preview.24` which was not part of the previous changelogs, see below.


## [0.3.5] - 2020-03-03

### Changed

* Updated dependencies of this package.


## [0.3.4] - 2020-02-17

### Changed

* Updated dependencies of this package.
* When creating entities from scratch with code, user now needs to manually add `RenderBounds` component. Instantiating prefab works as before.
* Inactive GameObjects and Prefabs with `StaticOptimizeEntity` are now correctly treated as static
* `RenderBoundsUpdateSystem` is no longer `public` (breaking)
* deleted public `CreateMissingRenderBoundsFromMeshRenderer` system (breaking)


## [0.3.3] - 2020-01-28

### Changed

* Updated dependencies of this package.


## [0.3.2] - 2020-01-16

### Changed

* Updated dependencies of this package.


## [0.3.1] - 2019-12-16

**This version requires Unity 2019.3.0f1+**

### Changes

* Updated dependencies of this package.


## [0.3.0] - 2019-12-03

### Changes

* Updated dependencies of this package.


## [0.2.0] - 2019-11-22

**This version requires Unity 2019.3 0b11+**

### New Features

* Added support for vertex skinning.

### Fixes

* Fixed an issue where disabled UnityEngine Components were not getting ignored when converted via `ConvertToEntity` (it only was working for subscenes).

### Changes

* Removed `LightSystem` and light conversion.
* Updated dependencies for this package.

### Upgrade guide

  * `Lightsystem` was not performance by default and the concept of driving a game object from a component turned out to be not performance by default. It was also not maintainable because every property added to lights has to be reflected in this package.
  * `LightSystem` will be replaced with hybrid entities in the future. This will be a more clean uniform API for graphics related functionalities.


## [0.1.1] - 2019-08-06

### Fixes

* Adding a disabled tag component, now correctly disables the light.

### Changes

* Updated dependencies for this package.


## [0.1.0] - 2019-07-30

### New Features

* New `GameObjectConversionSettings` class that we are using to help manage the various and growing settings that can tune a GameObject conversion.
* New ability to convert and export Assets, which is initially needed for Tiny.
  * Assets are discovered via `DeclareReferencedAsset` in the `GameObjectConversionDeclareObjectsGroup` phase and can then be converted by a System during normal conversion phases.
  * Assets can be marked for export and assigned a guid via `GameObjectConversionSystem.GetGuidForAssetExport`. During the System `GameObjectExportGroup` phase, the converted assets can be exported via `TryCreateAssetExportWriter`.
* `GetPrimaryEntity`, `HasPrimaryEntity`, and the new `TryGetPrimaryEntity` all now work on `UnityEngine.Object` instead of `GameObject` so that they can also query against Unity Assets.

### Upgrade guide

* Various GameObject conversion-related methods now receive a `GameObjectConversionSettings` object rather than a set of misc config params.
  * `GameObjectConversionSettings` has implicit constructors for common parameters such as `World`, so much existing code will likely just work.
  * Otherwise construct a `GameObjectConversionSettings`, configure it with the parameters you used previously, and send it in.
* `GameObjectConversionSystem`: `AddLinkedEntityGroup` is now `DeclareLinkedEntityGroup` (should auto-upgrade).
* The System group `GameObjectConversionDeclarePrefabsGroup` is now `GameObjectConversionDeclareObjectsGroup`. This cannot auto-upgrade but a global find&replace will fix it.
* `GameObjectConversionUtility.ConversionFlags.None` is gone, use 0 instead.

### Changes

* Changing `entities` dependency to latest version (`0.1.0-preview`).


## [0.0.1-preview.13] - 2019-05-24

### Changes

* Changing `entities` dependency to latest version (`0.0.12-preview.33`).


## [0.0.1-preview.12] - 2019-05-16

### Fixes

* Adding/fixing `Equals` and `GetHashCode` for proxy components.


## [0.0.1-preview.11] - 2019-05-01

Change tracking started with this version.
